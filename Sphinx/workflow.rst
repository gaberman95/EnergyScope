Getting Started
===============

The code, its documentation and the case study are gathered on a GitHub repository1. A README.md les summarises how to launch the energy model in four steps. Here below, we propose an extensive explanation including how to compute the typical days and manage data. The data are managed through excel les which are related ones to each others. The models are coded in AMPL, using the solver CPLEX. However, the energy model proposed can be run using the open-source GLPK and the GLPSOL solver.


Files structure and download
----------------------------

EnergyScope Typical Days (EnergyScope TD) is structured as shown in Figure 13. A main folder contains three sub-folders, rst one is dedicated to data management. Second, for the les related to typical days selection (STEP 1). Third and last branch regroups the les related to the energy model (STEP 2). Table 38 describes each les.
By ensuring that the download les respect the structure, the links between les should be respected and User could use the quick start procedure to launch the code.
